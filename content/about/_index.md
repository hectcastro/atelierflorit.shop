Two years ago I retired from the medical field, after a 39-year career. At times it was a lot, and at times it was the best. But it gave me meaning and purpose—it was my service. Not long after retiring I began caring for my grandniece (but she calls me grand mom) and continued working part time in the hospital every other weekend.

Then, the pandemic happened.

Initially, I was at odds with what to do. I had many long and thoughtful conversations about the options with my family and with myself, and ultimately, I made the decision to permanently step away from my career.

My family comes before everything; it was one of the hardest and easiest decisions I have ever made. Instead of sulking over stepping away from my career, I remembered other skills I had in my arsenal: sewing. So, I began sewing face coverings.

My mother, who was a professional seamstress in Cuba, taught me how to sew. She was a magical woman, and she taught me many, many things about the craft. Her namesake was the inspiration for this project: Atelier Florit.

I am truly blessed with my family and am proud to have their support and collaboration with my ideas! Everything we do and make is put together by family, from Philadelphia. I sew every mask myself. All cutting, color, accounting, production, and packaging takes place at home (in between breaks to sing and dance to Peppa Pig’s Bing Bong Song), while my sons in Seattle provide design consultation and market research.

Stay safe, and I hope you enjoy my work!

*Love*, Maida
